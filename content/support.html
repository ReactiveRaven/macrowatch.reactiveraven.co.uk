                <dt>Where did you get the formula for estimating calories burned?</dt>
                <dd>Resting energy is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris–Benedict_equation#Step_1_–_Calculating_the_Harris–Benedict_BMR">Mifflin update of the Harris-Benedict BMR formula</a>. The warning shown when underweight or obese is due to Mifflin et al only testing on 'normal' and 'overweight' weight classes. Active energy is a multiple of the user's BMR using values from the World Health Organisation paper <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5686e/y5686e07.htm#bm07.2">'Human energy requirements'</a>.</dd>
                <dt>What is the relationship between the 'lbs lost/gained' goal and calories?</dt>
                <dd>A pound of fat contains roughly 3500 calories. Divided by seven days, this is 500 calories per day. This is an oversimplification, as a person's weight will fluctuate due to water retention and other factors, and not all calories are processed in the digestive tract the same way, but over a long enough period it is a good enough approximation for most people.</dd>
                <dt>If I set specific macro grams, activity data import stops. If I then change my calories burned, the macro grams change. Why?</dt>
                <dd>Besides macronutrients, there is very little else in food that accounts for calories. The rough formula is 1g carb/protein = 4kcal. 1g fat = 9kcal. If you change your macro gram intake, you must change your calorie intake, and vice versa.</dd>
                <dt>The complications do not always update immediately. Why?</dt>
                <dd>Unfortunately this is out of the app's control. To save power, WatchOS limits the number of times (and number of seconds) per day the phone app can wake up the watch app. Parts of this budget are shared with other apps, so if another app misbehaves, or WatchOS decides it needs to save power, it will ignore updates from the phone. You can force Macro Watch complications to update by tapping them to open the Macro Watch app.</dd>
